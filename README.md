# Hi, I'm James 👋

I enjoy exploring data, analytics, and enterprise technology, finding creative ways to make complex systems and information easier to understand. My projects cover Victorian traffic data patterns, Australian Census population stats, and sales and budget data.

I enjoy transforming dirty data into actionable insights and visuals that support easy decision-making. I’m also passionate about automation, streamlining and simplifying workflows, and making data processes more efficient.

On this GitHub, you’ll find projects showcasing:
- Interactive dashboards (Power BI, Tableau, Excel, web-based visualisations)  
- SQL data modeling and analysis   
- Automation pipelines for repetitive data tasks
- Hobby passion projects for fun :)

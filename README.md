Welcome to my page! I am a tech enthusiast who has a passion for creating interesting tools and programs.

Though I work on a variety of projects, including data analysis and visualizations, I am curious in exploring different ways to make useful programs that can create a positive impact in the world.

Feel free to check out my work.

# Hi, I'm James 👋

I specialise in **data science** with a strong interest in **data analysis, visualization, and automation**. My projects cover **Victorian traffic data patterns**, **Australian Census population stats**, and **sales and budget data**, using tools like **Tableau**, **Power BI**, **SQL**, and **JavaScript/HTML/CSS**.  

I enjoy transforming raw data into **actionable insights** and building **interactive dashboards** that support decision-making. I’m also passionate about **automation**, streamlining workflows, and making data processes more efficient.

On this GitHub, you’ll find projects showcasing:
- **Interactive dashboards** (Power BI, Tableau, web-based visualizations)  
- **SQL data modeling and analysis**  
- **Web-based data visualizations** using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript  
- **Automation pipelines** for repetitive data tasks  

I aim to grow my career in **data science**, applying technical skills to solve real-world problems and deliver impactful insights.

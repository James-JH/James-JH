# Hi, I'm James 👋

Exploring data, analytics, and modern enterprise technology to build clear, decision-focused solutions. My projects cover Victorian traffic data patterns, Australian Census population stats, and sales and budget data.

I enjoy transforming dirty data into actionable insights and visuals that support easy decision-making. I’m also passionate about automation, streamlining and simplifying workflows, and making data processes more efficient.

On this GitHub, you’ll find projects showcasing:
- Interactive dashboards (Power BI, Tableau, Excel, web-based visualisations)  
- SQL data modeling and analysis   
- Automation pipelines for repetitive data tasks
- Hobby passion projects for fun :)

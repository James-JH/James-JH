# Hi, I'm James 👋

I have a passion in data analysis, visualisation, and automation. My projects cover Victorian traffic data patterns, Australian Census population stats, and sales and budget data, using the power of Excel, Power BI/Tableau, SQL, and JavaScript/HTML/CSS.  

I enjoy transforming raw dirty data into actionable insights and intuitive visuals that support easy decision-making. I’m also passionate about automation, streamlining and simplifying workflows, and making data processes more efficient.

On this GitHub, you’ll find projects showcasing:
- Interactive dashboards (Power BI, Tableau, web-based visualisations)  
- SQL data modeling and analysis   
- Automation pipelines for repetitive data tasks
- Hobby passion projects for fun :)
